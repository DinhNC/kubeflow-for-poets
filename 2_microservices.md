# Microservies Architecture

The Microservice architecture is an approach for developing and deploying enterprise software applications that involve separating the core business capabilities of the application into decoupled components. Each business capability represents some functionality that the application provides as services to the end-user. The idea of Microservices is in contrast to the Monolithic architecture which involves building applications as a composite of its "individual" capabilities.
