Kubeflow is a platform that is created to enhance and simplify the process of deploying machine learning workflows on Kubernetes. Using Kubeflow, it becomes easier to manage a distributed machine learning deployment by placing components in the deployment pipeline such as the training, serving, monitoring and logging components into containers on the Kubernetes cluster.

The goal of Kubeflow is to abstract away the technicalities of managing a Kubernetes cluster so that a machine learning practitioner can quickly leverage the power of Kubernetes and the benefits of deploying products within a microservices framework. Kubeflow has its history as an internal Google framework for deploying machine learning pipelines on Kubernetes before being open-sourced late 2017.
