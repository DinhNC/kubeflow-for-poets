# Docker

Docker is a virtualization application that abstracts applications into isolated environments known as *containers*. The idea behind a container is to provide a unified platform that includes the software tools and dependencies for developing and deploying an application.

The traditional way of developing applications is where an application is designed and hosted on a single server. This setup results in a number of problems including the famous "it works on my machine but not on yours". Also in this architecture, apps are difficult to scale and to migrate resulting in huge costs and slow deployment.
