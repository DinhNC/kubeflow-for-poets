# Docker

Docker is a virtualization application that abstracts applications into isolated environments known as *containers*. The idea behind a container is to provide a unified platform that includes the software tools and dependencies for developing and deploying an application.

The traditional way of developing applications is to have different staging environments, where one application is basically designed and hosted on a single server.
