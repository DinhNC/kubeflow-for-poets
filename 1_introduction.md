# Introduction

Machine learning is often and rightly viewed as the use of mathematical algorithms to teach the computer to learn tasks that are computationally infeasible to program as a set of specified instructions. However, the use of these algorithms happen to constitute only a tiny fraction of the overall learning pipeline from an Engineering perspective. Building high-performant and dynamic learning models includes a number of other critical components. These components actually dominate the space of concerns for delivering an end-to-end machine learning product.

A typical machine lerning production pipeline looks like the illustration below.
