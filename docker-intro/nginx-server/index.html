<h1>The Coming Glory</h1>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Romans 8:1</strong> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Romans 8:6</strong> For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Romans 8:10</strong> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Romans 8:18</strong> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Romans 8:39</strong> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
